# Main Window - Commands Overview

Galosh has a set of commands known as "slash commands" that allow you to use Galosh features through text commands.

If the text in the command line begins with `/`, Galosh will treat it as a slash command. If you want to send a command starting with `/` to the MUD,
either turn off [parsing mode](session.md#parsing) or type `//` instead of `/`. The slash commands supported by the main window are listed below.

If the text in the command line begins with `.`, Galosh will treat it as a speedwalk path. If you want to send a command starting with `.` to the
MUD, turn off parsing mode. See the [speedwalking](commands/speedwalk.md) documentation for more information.
